# Borrowers Solvency Study

The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to understand whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank — statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model — a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.

## Objectives

1. Preprocessing data in order to make it appropriate for use in data analysis.
2. Analyzing factors that may have an impact upon the ability of bank clients to repay their debt on time.

## Project Progress

We will get data on bank's borrowers from `bank_clients_data.csv`. No information is given regarding the quality of data. Thus, an inspection of data will be needed
before studying the main determinants of creditworthiness.

We will conduct data preprocessing and look for ways to correct the most critical data errors. 

The study will be carried out in three stages:

1. Data overview.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Creditworthiness determinants analysis.

## Data

The analysis is based on the following data on clients of some bank:

- Number of children
- Number of days being employed
- Age
- Education level
- Family status
- Gender
- Employment type
- Binary indicator of owing a debt
- Monthly income
- Loan purpose
