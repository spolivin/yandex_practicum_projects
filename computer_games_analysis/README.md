# Computer Games Market Analysis

The online store "Streamchik" engages in selling computer games all over the world. Thanks to open sources, there is access to historical data on game sales, user and 
expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation). The objective is to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow 
for selecting potentially popular products and optimizing advertising campaigns.

## Objectives

1. Identification of patterns correlating with the success of games.
2. Providing recommendations for planning advertising campaigns (year 2017).

## Project progress

Historical data on various features of the computer games market is stored in the file `games.csv`. Since nothing certain can be said about 
the quality of the data, a detailed overview and preprocessing of the data will be required. 

The data will be checked for errors, omissions and other inconsistencies and inaccuracies. In the process of data preparation, we will search for ways to 
correct and adjust critical errors in order to avoid any distortion of the results of the study. Furthermore, the data properly processed will be analyzed using 
exploratory data analysis tools. At the last stages of the study, the regional aspects of the computer games market will be analyzed, and a more detailed 
analysis will be carried out by checking statistical hypotheses.

Thus, the results of the study will be obtained during the following stages:

1. Data overview.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Exploratory data analysis.
4. Regional markets analysis.
5. Statistical hypotheses testing.
