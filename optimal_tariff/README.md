# Preferrable Tariff Choice

We act as an analyst of "Megaline" - federal mobile operator. Clients are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, 
the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money. 

We will have to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. We have the data of 500 Megaline users at our disposal: 
who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of 
customers and conclude which tariff is better.

## Objectives

1. Analyzing the behavior of "Megaline" company clients.
2. Identifying the most profitable tariff plan.
